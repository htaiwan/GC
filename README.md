### 6. You have a simple tree structure Ⓐ and its clone ⓐ.Each node in the tree has a pointer to it's parent as well as an array of its children. Given an original tree's node Ⓑ and cloned tree ⓐ, implement a method that returns ⓑ (the clone of Ⓑ). (Imagine finding the matching UIButton/UISlider/UIView in a separate cloned view controller.)
