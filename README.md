### 5. iOS developers have a "dispatch_after(when, queue, block   )" Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) function they can utilize but once it's set up, these calls can not be easily cancelled. Describe how you might implement a more convenient version of this named "cancellable_dispatch_after" 

 * How could you cancel a block in the operation queue after   it has been dispatched? 

 * Complex question about GCD and blocks. Prepare yourself to talk about issues that may occur (deadlock, starvation, strong reference cycles).
