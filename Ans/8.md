# 4. Connecting Graph

Given n nodes in a graph labeled from 1 to n. There is no edges in the graph at beginning.

You need to support the following method:
1. connect(a, b), add an edge to connect node a and node b. 2.query(a, b)`, check if two nodes are connected

``` Example
5 // n = 5
query(1, 2) return false
connect(1, 2)
query(1, 3) return false
connect(2, 4)
query(1, 4) return true

```
