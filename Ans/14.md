# 10. Sliding Window Maximum

Given an array of n integer with duplicate number, and a moving window(size k), move the window at each iteration from the start of the array, find the maximum number inside the window at each moving.

```
For array [1, 2, 7, 7, 8], moving window size k = 3. return [7, 7, 8]

At first the window is at the start of the array like this

[|1, 2, 7| ,7, 8] , return the maximum 7;

then the window move one step forward.

[1, |2, 7 ,7|, 8], return the maximum 7;

then the window move one step forward again.

[1, 2, |7, 7, 8|], return the maximum 8;
